# Kaggle

This repository is used to share my notebooks part of the public Kaggle competitions I have joined. I'll try to add clear comments ans explanations of my work.

Public competitions:
 - **Titanic**.- My first Kaggle notebook (python). Not very neat. 
 - **Titanic - R**.- Approaches to the solution in R.
 - **Housing - R**.- EDA in R. Only data analysis and missing dada imputation.
 - **Spaceship Titanic**.- Exploratory Data Analysis very complete.
 - **Tabular Playground Series. July 2022**
 - **Tabular Playground Series. August 2022**

Other folders:
 - **Tools and utilities**.- Templates, tools and functions generated by myself
